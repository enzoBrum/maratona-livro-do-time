Exercise:
There are n slots (from 1 to n). You start at slot 1. Say you are currently at slot 'x'. A random integer
'y' from 1 to n is chosen. If z=lcm(x, y) > n, then, the game ends. Else, you receive 1 coin and you go
to slot z. Print the expected number of coins given the probabilities of each number being selected.

Idea:
Let's build a Markov Chain of the input. To compute the edges, I'll use the fact that a
vertex 'i' only goes to a multiple of 'i'. That bounds the amount of edges by O(nlogn).
For each edge (i, m*i), I wanna see what 'j's randomly selected would lead me to go through it.
That is, which j have the following property:
lcm(i, j) = m*i
i*j/gcd(i, j) = m*i
j = m * gcd(i, j)

I don't know how to solve that mathematically, but I do know how to bruteforce it.
Iterate through every divisor 'g' of 'i' and consider it as a gcd of something. Compute
j = m*g
and see if that makes the equation true. If it does, we found a working 'j'.

Total complexity: O(nlogÂ³n)
